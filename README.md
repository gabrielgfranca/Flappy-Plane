## Flappy Plane

### About: 
  This game was developed during the game development course at NoNe Class. Unlike the previous project, this one involved a slightly deeper understanding of programming and a bit of animation. Again, the project was developed together with the professor, but this time with a little more freedom during development and also with several exercises during the lessons. I am happy to have finished this project; I learned a lot from it.

### Controls:
  Press the 'Space' key to move the plane up and, start the game.
